# Bulk IP Address Tracker PHP

This is a PHP script that enables you to track and retrieve information about a bulk list of IP addresses. The project demonstrates how to perform IP address tracking and gather details such as geolocation, organization, and more.

## Overview

The script reads a list of IP addresses from a CSV file and uses external APIs to gather information about each IP address. It then compiles the collected data into a report for analysis.

## Features

- Bulk IP address tracking using external APIs.
- Retrieve geolocation, organization, and other information for each IP.
- Utilize cURL library for making API requests.
- Export the collected data into a report for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
- Basic knowledge of PHP, CSV file handling, and making API requests.

## Usage

1. Upload the script to your web server.
2. Create a CSV file (`input.csv`) with a list of IP addresses.
3. Configure the script by updating the necessary settings.
4. Access the script through a web browser: `http://localhost/index.php`.

## Configuration

- Update the API keys and settings in the script to match your chosen IP tracking services.
- Customize the layout and structure of the generated report.

## Security Considerations

- Be cautious about the usage of sensitive data when tracking IP addresses.
- Use valid and ethical reasons for tracking IP addresses.

## Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational purposes and ethical use. Respect privacy and adhere to relevant laws and regulations when tracking IP addresses.
